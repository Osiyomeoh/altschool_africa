    <h1>Welcome to My AltSchool Profile</h1>
    <p><strong>Full Name:</strong> Samuel Aleonomoh</p>
    <p><strong>AltSchool ID:</strong> ALT/SOE/025/4357</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a passionate Full-Stack Software Engineer with nearly five years of experience in the tech industry. 
        Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work across different domains including web development, 
        blockchain, and startup product development. My technical stack includes JavaScript, React, Node.js, 
        Express, and MongoDB on the web side, as well as Solidity and Web3 tools for blockchain applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        My journey in tech has been filled with learning, challenges, and growth. Beyond writing code, I’m 
        also a startup founder, product thinker, and tech community contributor. I believe in continuous learning, 
        and that’s one of the reasons I joined AltSchool.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
    <p>
        Even though I’ve been in tech for a while, I realized the importance of community, structured learning, 
        and staying updated with best practices. As someone who’s been building products and managing teams, 
        it’s easy to drift away from the foundational principles that once shaped me. Here are my key reasons 
        for joining this program:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Reconnection with Fundamentals:</strong> I want to refresh my knowledge of the software engineering 
            basics—algorithms, data structures, design principles, and clean coding practices.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Stay Rooted in Code:</strong> As a startup founder, I spend a lot of time planning, delegating, and managing. 
            I want AltSchool to be the space where I return to hands-on development regularly.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Accountability and Growth:</strong> A structured learning environment will help me stay accountable, grow 
            alongside others, and engage in peer-to-peer learning.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Adapt to AI Integration:</strong> With AI tools like ChatGPT making development faster, I want to maintain 
            a deep understanding of how things work under the hood rather than just relying on automation.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>My Goals for the AltSchool Software Engineering Program (Frontend Stack)</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently focusing on the Frontend Engineering Track, and I have set clear, measurable goals 
        for myself to achieve throughout the duration of the program.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Master Core Frontend Concepts:</strong> From HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to React and modern frontend 
            tools, I aim to gain mastery over the frontend stack and be confident in building highly responsive and 
            accessible web applications.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Build a Strong Portfolio:</strong> I plan to create and document several real-world projects that reflect 
            my capabilities and can be showcased to potential employers or clients.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Contribute to Open Source:</strong> I want to give back to the community by contributing to open-source 
            projects that solve real problems, especially those that empower African developers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Land a Global Remote Role:</strong> My target is to land a frontend development job with a reputable 
            international company, with a salary of at least $5,000/month, allowing me to grow my impact and financial freedom.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mentor and Teach:</strong> Once I’ve sharpened my skills further, I want to help junior developers and 
            share my knowledge—whether through blog posts, videos, or mentorship.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
        I believe that AltSchool is a timely and valuable opportunity for me. The journey of a developer is a lifelong 
        one, and this is another intentional step in mine. I’m excited to collaborate with classmates, learn from 
        instructors, and push myself to the next level professionally and personally.
